Sign language serves as a vital form of communication for millions of individuals worldwide who are deaf or hard of hearing. However, the significant communication gap between sign language users and the broader 
community persists, hindering effective interaction and inclusivity. This project endeavors to address this challenge by developing an advanced gesture recognition model capable of accurately identifying and 
interpreting sign language gestures from video input. This project focuses on developing a gesture recognition model for sign language, aimed at enhancing communication for individuals who rely on sign 
language. Leveraging machine learning and computer vision, the system interprets sign language gestures from video input in realtime. With a user-friendly interface, it translates these gestures 
into text or spoken language, breaking down communication barriers and promoting inclusivity. This technology holds promise for a more connected and inclusive society, benefiting both sign 
language users and the broader community. In summary, the” Gesture Recognition for Sign Language” project aspires to create an innovative solution that not only empowers sign language 
users but also promotes a world where effective communication knows no bounds. Through cutting-edge technology, this project endeavors to bridge communication gaps and foster greater 
inclusivity for all.
